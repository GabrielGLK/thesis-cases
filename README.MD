# **Numerical simulation of single spherical bubble rising**
This is one classical benchmark test case, the test case comes from

# **Numerical simulation of Taylor bubble rising in stagnant liquid** 
In this part, we introduce the test cases using Basilisk to simulate Taylor bubble rising in quiescent liquid through singularities. The comparisons have been done between experiments results from Chengsi and simulations results, including bubble rising in straight tube and expansion/contraction tube.

In addtion, we extend the simulation cases into several new singularities, including gradual, parabolic concave/convex expansions/contractions. I will introduce more in the following parts:
