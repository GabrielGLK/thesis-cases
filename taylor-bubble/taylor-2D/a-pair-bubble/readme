This code can be used to calculate the cases in the reference paper:

Simulation of slug flow systems under laminar regime: Hydrodynamics with individual and a pair of consecutive Taylor bubbles

One more idea can be used here is using viscoelastic fluid to recalculate the cases, 
in Basilisk solver, you can set viscoelastic properties here:
