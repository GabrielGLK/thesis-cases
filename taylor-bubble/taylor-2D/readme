Before studying singularities, we investigated a single Taylor bubble rising in straight tube, including:
1). Comparison with chengsi's experimental results, note: in experiments, it's difficult to define the 
initial length of Taylor bubble, therefore, we measured the Taylor bubble size from experimental videos.
Five expansion ratios are given in his experiments: 1.72, 1.45, 1.33, 1.24, 1.12
Four contraction ratios are given: 0.95, 0.9, 0.8, 0.69

2). Reference data from paper:
Wide-ranging survey on the laminar flow of individual Taylor bubbles rising through stagnant Newtonian liquids

3). 


We have given 4 different singularities for expansions/contractions. They are sudden, convex parabolic, concave parabolic 
expansion and contractions.
