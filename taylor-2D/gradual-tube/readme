This is for gradual singularities. You can change gradual degree in 'degree.h' under same expansion ratio which set in 'experiment.h'

The thought of gradual singularity is:
1). we can change expansion ratio
2). under same expansion ratio to change gradual degree

This also can be applied for gradual contraction geometries.
