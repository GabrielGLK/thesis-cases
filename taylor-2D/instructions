1. film_thickness_prediction
using 95% to validate the Taylor bubble terminal state is independent on initial film thickness.
Here the initial thickness is 0.2*R_0, so we use the correlation to accelerate the calculation to stable state.

2. Initial bubble length 
80% 1.24
using different initial bubble length (l0=4r0,5r0,6r0,7r0,8r0,9r0) to observe the difference of terminal

Calculate from 6r0, because in Araujo's study, they conclude that the bubble initial length should be at least
3times of frontal diameters, so we calculate the cases from 6r0 to 9r0

3. mesh analysis
80% 1.24
Try to validate the mesh independency analysis using h=1/[64,128,256,512], corresponding to grid level [10,11,12,13]
